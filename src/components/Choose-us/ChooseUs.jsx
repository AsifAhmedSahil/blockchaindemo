                This course introduces the basic concepts of blockchain and how
                to leverage the benefits of blockchain in business, as well as
                technical skills of how to build blockchain solutions.<br/> The
                course teaches Hyperledger Composer. It includes a lab that
                teaches students to build a JavaScript application to query and
                update a pre-populated blockchain network ledger. The course is
                generally focused on building blockchain business networks.<br/> To
                complete labs in the course, an understanding of object-oriented
                programming is required. The course is taught by IBM employees.
